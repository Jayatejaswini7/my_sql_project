Project Experience:
Designing and implementing the Employee Management System (EMS) was a hands-on experience that deepened my understanding of relational database design, SQL query writing, and real-world HR data management. The system was structured around six interrelated tables, each serving a core function in managing employee details, job roles, salaries, qualifications, leaves, and payroll processing.

Key Learnings:
Efficient schema design and normalization reduce redundancy and simplify querying.
Foreign key constraints with appropriate cascading actions are vital for maintaining referential integrity.
SQL queries can become significantly more complex with multiple joins, but they enable powerful data insights.
Clear documentation of assumptions, constraints, and data flows improves maintainability.
